# Assignment 1: Fruit Catcher
**CS50 Week 0 - Scratch Programming**

## Overview
This is Assignment 1 for CS50 Week 0, where I created a Scratch game called "Fruit Catcher." This project demonstrates basic programming concepts using visual programming in Scratch.

## Game Description
Fruit Catcher is an interactive Scratch game where:
- The player controls a bowl at the bottom of the screen
- Fruits fall from the top of the screen at random positions
- The objective is to catch as many fruits as possible using the bowl
- A score counter tracks the number of fruits successfully caught
- The game gets progressively more challenging as time goes on

## Screenshot
Here's a look at the Fruit Catcher game in action:

## Programming Concepts Demonstrated
- **Sprites and Movement**: Bowl character controlled by user input
- **Random Generation**: Fruits appear at random positions
- **Collision Detection**: Detecting when fruits hit the bowl
- **Variables**: Score counter and game state management
- **Loops**: Continuous game loop and fruit generation
- **Conditionals**: Game logic and scoring conditions
- **Events**: User input handling and game interactions

## Learning Objectives
This assignment helped me understand:
- Basic programming logic and flow control
- Event-driven programming concepts
- Game development fundamentals
- Visual programming with Scratch
- Problem decomposition and algorithmic thinking

## Files
- `fruit-catcher.sb3` - The Scratch project file (to be added)
- `screenshots/` - Game screenshots and documentation (to be added)

## How to Play
1. Open the Scratch project in the Scratch editor
2. Click the green flag to start the game
3. Use arrow keys or mouse to move the bowl left and right
4. Catch falling fruits to increase your score
5. Try to achieve the highest score possible!

## Development Notes
This game was developed as part of my CS50 learning journey. It represents my first foray into programming concepts and game development. The project focuses on understanding fundamental programming principles through visual programming.
